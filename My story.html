      <h1>MY STORY</h1>
      <h2>I come from Taiwan, which is a small and beautiful country. 
        Since I was a child, I have liked watching Japanese animation. I often imagine the plot 
        of an animation in my head. Sometimes I even imagine that I am the character inside. 
        When I was in college, I studied in the animation department. Because of my loverâ€™s relationship,
        I am more certain to do animation. Because animation can bring people laughter and even the meaning of life.
      </h2>
        <h3>
        I also love to create the animation to effect the world. My job is for goverment to create animation to let
        the society become better.
      </h3>
      
      <h4>
        I like to particle, 3d render and 2d animation and do transition. Every genre for animation I want to do.
        Maybe someday I can create many different style of animation and become generlist artist.
